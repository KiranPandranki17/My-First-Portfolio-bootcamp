          <p>
            MSc Mechanical Engineering student with a year in industry
            experience, seeking a graduate role in Mechanical Engineering, with
            the aim of becoming a chartered engineer. I was thrilled to be given
            the opportunity to apply what I had learned during my academic to
            engineering problems. My studies have given me a comprehensive
            understanding of mechanical engineering methodologies, tools,
            software packages, and approaches. Alongside this, I learned how to
            collaborate with other people, which improves the way I worked in a
            team to reach a common goal during my placement, and this helped me
            to hone my communication, and team player skills.
